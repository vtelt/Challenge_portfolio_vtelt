## General Information
Hello! I am very happy to participate in portfolio challenge. For me it's a way to come back to my profession. I was in maturity leave for a long period, before that I worked as Manual QA for 6 years. I see my future as Automation QA, so I was very happy when I heard about your challenge. 
*Thank you for this chance!*
